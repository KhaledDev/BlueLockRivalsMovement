Soccer Ball Physics
Looking for an experienced scripter who is able to script an entire Ball Physics System in my game, similar to that of popular game "BLUE LOCK RIVALS", with a few adjustments on the curve and velocity.

The system must include:

Ball Physics
Tackling (done requires testing)
Dribbling (done requires testing)
Shooting (with curve depending on how long the player held the left click button)
Passing  (with smaller curve depending on how long the player held the right click button)
Welded to the player (done)
